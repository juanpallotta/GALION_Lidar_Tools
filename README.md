# GALION_Lidar_Tools
Set of tools for GALION Network (https://galion.world/) for metadata automation and submission.


## Introduction

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Aerosol Lidar Observation Network (GALION) was formed in 2008. GALION is a lidar network of networks organized through the GAW program to coordinate network activities and provide comprehensive profiling of atmospheric aerosols, clouds, gases, and thermodynamic structure (from https://galion.world/).


In order to homogenize the data, GALION Network uses JSON data files to report their measurements. The JSON files contain metadata reporting general information about the site, its status and the persons in charge. Also, 

The script ***galion_auto_json_generator.py*** is a command line tool to fill the variable ***available*** inside the *json* file based on the saved LICEL lidar files.

## Installation
This Python code only needs three libraries to run: ***os***, ***sys*** and ***json***. All can be installed in a single command line using *pip*:

```
pip install os sys json
```

Once this is done, you are ready to run ***galion_auto_json_generator.py***.
